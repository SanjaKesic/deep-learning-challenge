Analysis involved creating and optimizing a binary classification model based on dataset of a charity organization. Target of the analysis was to determine the probability of success of the given project application taking into account different variables.

Data was imported into google collab notebook in csv format, preprocessed with pandas, and keras sequential modeling was used. 
Various steps were then taken to optimize the model, utilizing Relu activation function. Detailed analysis report and summary is located in the `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb' google colab notebook.
